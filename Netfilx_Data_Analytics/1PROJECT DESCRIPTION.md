# **Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis: A Deep Dive into Streaming Trends**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
With the ever-growing catalog of content on Netflix, understanding trends in Movies and TV Shows is crucial. This project takes a deep dive into Netflix’s content library, separating Movies and TV Shows for a **detailed comparative analysis**. 

One major limitation in the original dataset was that **TV Show duration was given only in terms of seasons**, making it difficult to compare with Movies. To bridge this gap, I leveraged **web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup and Selenium** to extract the **number of episodes for each TV show from IMDb**. 

Using **data visualization and statistical analysis**, I uncovered trends related to **content duration, rating distribution, country-wise production, and more**, giving a clearer picture of how Netflix’s content is structured.
